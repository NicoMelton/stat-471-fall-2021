# Socioeconomics and the COVID-19 case-fatality rate {-}

The coronavirus pandemic emerged in 2020 and is still impacting our lives today. COVID-19 has had a disparate impact on different counties across the United States. A key measure of this impact is the *case-fatality ratio*, defined as the ratio of the number of deaths to the number of cases. Three STAT 471 students from spring 2021 (Yoon Chang, Jess Mixon, and Maayan Waldman) set out to study how a variety of variety of health, clinical, socioeconomic, and physical factors affected the case-fatality ratio. In this exam, we will be retracing their steps. The analysis will focus on the data from 2020, before the availability of COVID vaccines.

The data come in two parts: Case and death tracking data from The New York Times (available [online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv)) and 41 county-level health and socioeconomic factors compiled by the [County Health Rankings and Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/), available to you as `county_health_data.tsv` (see the Appendix below for descriptions of all features). The county health data have been cleaned for you, and counties with missing data have been removed. Counties are identified in both datasets using a five-digit *FIPS code*.

# Wrangling (25 points for correctness; 5 points for presentation)

## Import (5 points)

- Import the NYT data directly from the URL below into a tibble called `case_data_raw`. Print this tibble (no need to make a fancy table out of it).
- Import the county health data from `../../data/county_health_data.tsv` into a tibble called `county_health_data`. Print this tibble (no need to make a fancy table out of it).

**Solution.**

**Read in the data using `read_csv` and `read_tsv` and print.**

```{r}
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv"
case_data_raw = read_csv(url) # read NYT data
case_data_raw # print
county_health_data = read_tsv("data/county_health_data.tsv") # import county health data
county_health_data # print
```

## Transform (15 points)

The NYT data contain case and death information for both 2020 and 2021, whereas we would like to focus our analysis only on 2020. Also, the data are broken down by day, whereas we would like to calculate an overall case-fatality ratio per county, defined as the total deaths in 2020, divided by the total cases in 2020, multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.

- Transform `case_data_raw` into a tibble called `case_data` with one row per county and four columns: `fips`, `county`, `state`, and `case_fatality_rate`, the latter containing the overall case-fatality ratio for 2020. [Hints: (1) There are several ways to filter the observations from 2020, but some are slower than others. For a faster option, check out the `year()` function from the `lubridate` package. (2) To keep columns in a tibble after `summarise()`, include them in `group_by()`. Just remember to `ungroup()` after summarizing.]
- Print the resulting tibble (no need to make a fancy table out of it). How many counties are represented in `case_data`? How does it compare to the number of counties in `county_health_data`? What is a likely explanation for this discrepancy?

**Solution**

```{r}
case_data = case_data_raw %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(fips, county, state) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases),
            total_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(case_fatality_rate = total_deaths / total_cases * 100) %>%
  select(fips, county, state, case_fatality_rate)
case_data
nrow(case_data)
nrow(county_health_data)
```

**There are `r nrow(case_data)` counties represented in `case_data`. This is way more counties than the `r nrow(county_health_data)` counties in `county_health_data`. This is likely because the data in `county_health_data` is harder to collect and may come from a sample of the county population, so only large counties or counties with good data collection are able to have adequate health data.**

## Merge (5 points)

- Merge `county_health_data` with `case_data` into one tibble called `covid_data` using `inner_join()`, which keeps counties represented in both datasets. See `?inner_join` or Google for documentation and examples. Print `covid_data` (no need to create a nice table).

**Solution**

```{r}
covid_data = case_data %>% inner_join(county_health_data, by = "fips") # inner_join by "fips"
covid_data # print
```

**Use `inner_join` to join datasets by "fips".**

# Exploration (30 points for correctness; 5 points for presentation)

## Response distribution (15 points)

- Compute the median of the case-fatality rate in `covid_data`.
- Create a histogram of the case-fatality rate in `covid_data`, with a dashed vertical line at the median. Comment on the shape of this distribution.
- Create a (nice) table of the top 10 counties by case-fatality rate, as well as a heatmap of the case-fatality rate across the U.S. (the code to produce the heatmap is provided in the Rmd file; no need to modify it at all). Based on the table, what region of the U.S. tended to have the highest overall case-fatality rates in 2020? In what sense does the heatmap reflect this?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# create a heatmap of case fatality rate across the U.S.
map_data("county") %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  left_join(case_data %>% 
              rename(region = state, 
                     subregion = county,
                     `Case Fatality Rate` = case_fatality_rate) %>% 
              mutate(region = str_to_lower(region), 
                     subregion = str_to_lower(subregion)), 
            by = c("region", "subregion")) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data=map_data("state"), 
               aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group),
               color="black", fill=NA,  size = 1, alpha = .3) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill = `Case Fatality Rate`),
               color="darkblue", size = .1) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_void()
```

**Solution**

```{r}
# find median case fatality rate
median_case_fatality_rate = covid_data %>% pull(case_fatality_rate) %>% median()
median_case_fatality_rate # print

# plot histogram of case fatality rate
covid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(case_fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_case_fatality_rate, 
             linetype="dashed", color = "red") +
  theme_bw()

# make table of top 10 counties by case fatality rate
covid_data %>%
  arrange(desc(case_fatality_rate)) %>%
  select(fips, county, state, case_fatality_rate) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  kable(format = "latex", row.names = NA, 
        booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2, 
        col.names = c("FIPS", "Name", "State", "Case Fatality Rate"),
        caption = "Top Ten US Counties by Case Fatality Rate") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```

**Based on the table, the Northeast tends to have the highest overall case fatality rates in 2020. Nine of ten counties in the table come from a state in this region. The heatmap reflects this because there is a concentration of red around this region, especially in northern New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.**

## Response-feature relationships (15 points)

- To prevent selection bias, it's good practice to split off a test set before exploring response-feature relationships. Create a test set `covid_test` by filtering counties belonging to the first six states (in alphabetical order) that are represented in `covid_data`; these should be Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, and Connecticut. Create a training set `covid_train` containing the rest of the counties.

- The features come in four different categories: health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. Create scatter plots of the case fatality ratio against one feature in each of these categories (`obesity_perc`, `uninsured`, `segregation_nonwhite_white`, `high_housing_costs`), adding the least squares line to each and putting the y-axis on a log scale using `scale_y_log10()` for visualization purposes and collating these plots into a single figure. 

- Which of these four features appears to have the strongest relationship with the case-fatality ratio? What appears to be the direction of the relationship, and why might this relationship exist?

**Solution.**

```{r}
# list of first six states by alphabetical order
first_six_states = c("Alabama", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut")
# test set called covid_test
covid_test = covid_data %>%
  filter(state %in% first_six_states)
# training set called covid_train
covid_train = covid_data %>%
  filter(!state %in% first_six_states)

# scatter plot of case `case_fatality_ratio` against `obesity_perc`
plot_op = covid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = obesity_perc, y = case_fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()

# scatter plot of case `case_fatality_ratio` against `uninsured`, 
plot_u = covid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = uninsured, y = case_fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()

# scatter plot of case `case_fatality_ratio` against `segregation_nonwhite_white`
plot_snw = covid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = segregation_nonwhite_white, y = case_fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()

# scatter plot of case `case_fatality_ratio` against `high_housing_costs`
plot_rhc = covid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = high_housing_costs, y = case_fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()

# plot all in same figure with cowplot
plot_grid(plot_op, plot_u, plot_snw, plot_rhc)

```

**Of the four features, `segregation_nonwhite_white` seems to have by far the strongest relationship with `case_fatality_rate`. The relationship is positive, with an increase in `segregation_nonwhite_white` correlating with an increase in `case_fatality_rate`. This could be the case because `segregation_nonwhite_white`is an indicator of economic and racial inequality. Inequality leads to the less fortunate to lack health care access and other means of staying safe during covid.**


# Modeling (30 points for correctness; 5 points for presentation)

Next, let's train penalized regression models to predict the case-fatality ratio based on the available features.

## Ridge regression (8 points)

- Fit a 10-fold cross-validated ridge regression to `covid_train`.

**Solution.**
```{r}
set.seed(1)  # for replicability (do not change)
ridge_fit = cv.glmnet(case_fatality_rate ~ . - fips - county - state,  
                      alpha = 0,                 # alpha = 0 for ridge
                      nfolds = 10,               # 10 folds
                      data = covid_train)   # data
```

- Produce the corresponding CV plot. What are `lambda.min` and `lambda.1se`, and where are these two indicated in the CV plot? 

**Solution.**

```{r}
# CV plot
plot(ridge_fit)
```

**"lamba.min" is `r ridge_fit$lambda.min` and is represented on the plot by the dashed line on the left. "lamda.1se" is `r ridge_fit$lambda.1se` and is represented on the plot by the dashed line on the right. **

- Produce the ridge trace plot, highlighting the top 6 features. Based on `lambda.1se`, which feature appears to have the strongest negative impact on the case-fatality ratio? Is the reason for this relationship apparent to you? Does this ridge regression result imply a statistically significant relationship between this feature and the case-fatality rate?

**Solution.**

```{r}
plot_glmnet(ridge_fit, covid_train, features_to_plot = 6)
```

**`segregation_nonwhite_white` seems to have the the strongest positive impact on `case_fatality_rate'. It is unclear which feature has the strongest negative impact because it is not one of the 6 most impactful features. The ridge regression result does NOT imply a statistically significant relationship between `segregation_nonwhite_white` and `case_fatality_rate'.**

## Lasso regression (14 points)

- Fit a 10-fold cross-validated lasso regression to `covid_train`.

**Solution.**
```{r}
set.seed(1)  # for replicability (do not change)
lasso_fit = cv.glmnet(case_fatality_rate ~ . - fips - county - state,  
                      alpha = 1,                 # alpha = 0 for ridge
                      nfolds = 10,               # 10 folds
                      data = covid_train)   # data
```

- Produce the corresponding CV plot. What is another name for the model represented in the left-most edge of the CV plot? Why does it perform poorly?

**Solution.**

```{r}
plot(lasso_fit)
```

**Another name for the model representing the left-most edge of the CV plot is the standard linear least squares model. It seems to perform just as well when measured by MSE but is not prefered because it has fair more features and therefore is not as simple and easy to interpret. **

- How many features with nonzero coefficients are there in the lasso model selected by the one-standard error rule? 

**Solution.**

```{r}
beta_hat_std = extract_std_coefs(lasso_fit, covid_train)
nrow(beta_hat_std %>% filter(coefficient != 0))
```

**There are 13 features with nonzero coefficients.**

- Produce the lasso trace plot, highlighting the top 6 features. What is the first feature entering the model with a positive coefficient? What is the first feature entering the model with a negative coefficient?

**Solution.**

```{r}
plot_glmnet(lasso_fit, covid_train)
```

**The first feature entering the model with a positive coefficient is `segregation_nonwhite_white`. It is unclear which is the first feature entering the model with a negative coefficient**

- Produce a nice table of all features with nonzero coefficients in the lasso model selected by the one-standard-error rule, ordered by their coefficient magnitudes. What is the coefficient of `flu_vaccine_perc`, and how do we interpret it? Comment on the sign of this coefficient.

**Solution.**

```{r}
beta_hat_std %>% 
  filter(coefficient != 0) %>%
  arrange(desc(coefficient)) %>%
  kable(format = "latex", row.names = NA, 
        booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")
  
```

**`flu_vaccine_perc` has a coefficient of 0.02. Which means that for every 1% change in flue**


## Performance evaluation (8 points)

- Evaluate the RMSE of the ridge and lasso methods, both with `lambda` chosen using the one-standard-error-rule. For the sake of comparison, also evaluate the RMSE of the intercept-only prediction rule, which predicts the mean case-fatality ratio in the training data for all counties. Print these three RMSE values in a nice table.

**Solution.**


- Which of the two penalized regression methods performs better, and how does its performance compare to the intercept-only model? Contextualize the latter comparison in terms of the bias-variance trade-off. 

**Solution.**
